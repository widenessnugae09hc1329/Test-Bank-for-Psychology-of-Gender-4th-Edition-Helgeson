  * Unlike other gender texts, Psychology of Gender focuses equally on both men and women, drawing from empirical research and conceptual discussions.The book includes research and discussions surrounding gender in the areas of psychology, sociology, anthropology, medicine, and public health. It reviews the research from multiple perspectives, but emphasizes the implications of social roles, status, and gender-related traits, particularly for relationships and health–areas that are central to students' lives and that have a great impact on their day-to-day functioning. The text is designed for upper-level undergraduate/graduate-level gender-focused courses in a variety of departments.
